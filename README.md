# YTDownloader

## Why?

My father is the type of person who prefers to have his stuff offline, and when he discovered YouTube he naturally tried to download all the music and videos he liked. We have that in common.

To keep him from having to get into untrustworthy webpages to download the videos, I made him a little BATCH script some time ago that would wrap [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) (and later [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)) to give him a simple interface to use a very powerful tool.

Having to keep the downloader program up-to-date would prove to be very inconvenient as time passed, so yesterday I decided to make the foundation for a better wrapper for him to use, the idea is to implement more things and stuff.

**This project uses .NET Framework 4.7.2**, I know everyone is feeling super cool with their .NET 6 and 7 but come on, the whole point here is to make things easier for my dad, and chances of him having already installed .NET Framework 4.7.2 are massive to, you know... compatibilitiyltioylty :) (at least with Windows).
